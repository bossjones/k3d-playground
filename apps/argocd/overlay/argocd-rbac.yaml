  # RBAC Permission StructureÂ¶
  # Breaking down the permissions definition differs slightly between applications and every other resource type in Argo CD.

  # All resources except application-specific permissions (see next bullet):

  # p, <role/user/group>, <resource>, <action>, <object>

  # Applications, applicationsets, logs, and exec (which belong to an AppProject):

  # p, <role/user/group>, <resource>, <action>, <appproject>/<object>
